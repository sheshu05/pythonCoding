Split Function will ensure that it devides the output by the parameter and input that as a list.
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†
Average_height = float(sum(student_heights) / len(student_heights))
Average_height_new = int(round(Average_height, 0))
print(f"{Average_height_new}")
